==The Brew Garden

The Brew Garden is a crowdfunding platform specifically for the craftbeer industry.  It is a way for craft breweries to raise capital and for craftbeer fans to buy exclusive products and experiences.

This was done as a final project at Bitmaker Labs and can be found at brewgarden.herokuapp.com.
