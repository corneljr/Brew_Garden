    <div class="small-12">
      <h4>What is Crowdfunding?</h4>
      <p>Crowdfunding is a financing method that involves funding a project with relatively modest contributions from a large group of individuals. Leveraging social media and Brew Garden this can all be done completely online.</p>

      <h4>Who uses Brew Garden?</h4>
      <p>Brewers and beer lovers looking to learn more about the craft brew industry. In addition to just breweries, Brew Garden supports the entire ecosystem of beer. Brew Garden welcomes any subset to the industry such as hops farms, craft beer gardens, craft beer festivals, bottling plants and even brew pubs.</p>

      <h4>Why do people contribute to campaigns?</h4>
      <p>People contribute to campaigns to support their local brewery in exchange the perks or rewards that are part of the campaign.</p>

      <h4>How do I market my campaign to the Crowd?</h4>
      <p>Take advantage of social media! All it takes is one person to spread your brew and brand like a virus. Your loyal customers are also your greatest marketing asset.</p>
      <p>Also, please don’t underestimate the power of a video for your campaign on Brew Garden. It shows the human side of your business, brand and brew. You can run your campaign from 21 – 45 days. The option is yours.</p>

      <h4>How much does Brew Garden cost?</h4>
      <p>Brew Garden is free to join and explore.
      Brew Garden is currently set up for flexible funding which means you take what you raise minus fees regardless of reaching the funding goal. Brew Garden is currently free for the Brewery to use.

      Please note that Stripe charges a 2.9% fee AND $0.30 per transaction. https://stripe.com/us/pricing

      All donations from the donors will be charged regardless of whether or not the campaign reaches its funding goal. Flexible funding is just that – flexible…. It is the campaigners responsibility to come up with a contingency plan with regard to fulfilling rewards if full funding isn’t met.</p>

      <h4>What is Stripe?</h4>
      <p>Stripe is a global e-commerce business allowing money payments and transfers to be made via the internet. https://stripe.com </p>

      <h4>How do I contribute to a campaign?</h4>
      <p>Once you see a campaign you would like to contribute to, simply click on the reward and checkout.</p>

      <h4>Can I sell or offer beer and other alcohol containing products as rewards?</h4>
      <p>Please note: No beer or alcohol can be offered as a reward on the Brew Garden Site without having the proper distribution channels in place. Please understand your provincial beer laws. Offering coupons and club memberships that can be turned in for a physical pick up is fine. We want to be clear that as a portal we do not advocate the sale of alcohol related products and do NOT advocate underage drinking. Be creative with your rewards.</p>

      <h4>Who is responsible for completing a project as promised?</h4>
      <p>It’s the fundraiser’s responsibility to complete their project. Brew Garden is not involved in the development of the projects themselves. Brew Garden does not guarantee projects nor does it investigate a fundraiser’s ability to complete their project. It is up to you, the donor, to determine the validity of the project and fundraiser.</p>
